# Neural-Network-from-scratch

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've documented my journey of building a neural network from scratch. Inspired by <b>Samson Zhang's</b> video, I embarked on this endeavor to deepen my understanding of neural networks and their underlying principles.

<b> Why I Built This </b> <br>

Building a neural network from scratch isn't merely an exercise in coding; it's a journey of discovery and enlightenment. By understanding the nuts and bolts of neural networks, I aim to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
